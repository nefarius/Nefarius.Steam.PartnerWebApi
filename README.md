Steamworks Web API wrapper for .NET using [Refit](https://github.com/reactiveui/refit).

## About

*Very* work in progress, use with care ðŸ”¥

A thin dotnet wrapper library for for the Steamworks Web API that will grow with the author's needs.

Currently only covers parts of the `ISteamUser` interface. 

## API Access

This API requires a special [publisher web API key](https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi_overview/auth#publisher-keys) you can only obtain as a partner. This is **not the same** as the [Steam Web API Key](https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey) anyone with a Steam account can register. Do not expect this API to work with such a key.

## Example

```csharp
using Nefarius.Steam.PartnerWebApi;
using Nefarius.Steam.PartnerWebApi.Models;

using Refit;

string apiKey = "get api key from config file";

ISteamUser steamApi = RestService.For<ISteamUser>("https://partner.steam-api.com");

AppOwnershipResponse ownership = await steamApi.CheckAppOwnership(apiKey, "76561197992990756", "774361");

bool ownsApp = ownership.AppOwnership.OwnsApp;
```
